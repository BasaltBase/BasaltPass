# Tenant Administration

In BasaltPass, a **Tenant** is an isolated environment for your organization or project. As a Tenant Admin, you have full control over the users, roles, and configuration within your tenant.

## Accessing the Console

The Tenant Console is your control center.
-   **Default URL**: `http://localhost:5174` (local) or your deployed domain.
-   **Login**: Use your admin credentials.

## Dashboard Overview

Upon login, you will see the **Dashboard**, which provides a snapshot of your tenant's health:
-   **Total Users**: Number of registered users.
-   **Active Sessions**: Currently logged-in users.
-   **Recent Activity**: Audit logs of recent actions.

## Tenant Settings

You can configure tenant-specific settings:
-   **Display Name**: The name shown to users.
-   **Branding**: Logo and color scheme (if supported).
-   **Security Policies**: Password complexity, MFA requirements.
