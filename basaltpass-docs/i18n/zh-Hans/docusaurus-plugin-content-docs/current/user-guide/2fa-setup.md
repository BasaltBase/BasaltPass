# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

BasaltPass supports TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for 2FA.

## User Setup

1.  Log in to the **User Console**.
2.  Go to **Profile** > **Security**.
3.  Click **Enable 2FA**.
4.  Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy).
5.  Enter the verification code to confirm.

## Admin Controls

Tenant Admins can view which users have 2FA enabled but cannot view the secret keys. Admins can reset 2FA for users who have lost their device.
